      <h3>Modern Workspace and Cloud Technology</h3>
      Cloud technology has revolutionized the way we store and access data. A
      comprehensive knowledge of this technology is not just about understanding
      how to use it, but understanding its architecture, advantages, potential

      understanding the various service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deployment
      models (public, private, hybrid, community cloud), and the key providers

      effective strategies to resolve them. Furthermore, it is about keeping up
      with the latest trends and developments in this rapidly evolving field.
